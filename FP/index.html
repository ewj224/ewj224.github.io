As a result, I ended up taking on another challenge of trying to use blender to create my desired 3D scene. The process of understanding 3js itself was a lot of trial and error due to the fact that there was just a lot of information and terminology that I failed to understand. This all resulted in me attempting to research more about 3js and its requirements and how these things would work in relation to my piece. I found that 3js positioning is rather hard to grasp and generate and was the main reason why I decided to go back to blender instead. After finishing this process, implementing the assets into 3js became another challenge and learning to frame the assets in the way that I desired proved to be rather difficult. As I am new to both 3js and blender, I ended up creating a base model for the final and hope to use this as a means to continue learning 3js on my own projects in the near future. ";

			<p>AMBI is music application designed to pair audio with visual input. The app features multiple rooms, each 
				representing a certain genre/type of music with a customizable avatar that is able to perform actions in the room. 
				As it is designed to be on an app interface, the application would hold the shape of a cube with each side reveal a different type of room. 
				AMBI serves the purpose of further enhancing one's experience with music while also creating avenues to customize the experience 
				to one's liking. In the future, I hope to even add a VR element to the application so that one could even travel in these spaces in Virtual Reality.
