As a result, I ended up taking on another challenge of trying to use blender to create my desired 3D scene. The process of understanding 3js itself was a lot of trial and error due to the fact that there was just a lot of information and terminology that I failed to understand. This all resulted in me attempting to research more about 3js and its requirements and how these things would work in relation to my piece. I found that 3js positioning is rather hard to grasp and generate and was the main reason why I decided to go back to blender instead. After finishing this process, implementing the assets into 3js became another challenge and learning to frame the assets in the way that I desired proved to be rather difficult. As I am new to both 3js and blender, I ended up creating a base model for the final and hope to use this as a means to continue learning 3js on my own projects in the near future. ";
