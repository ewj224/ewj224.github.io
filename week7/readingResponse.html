      I think what was so interesting about this piece was how he states that with new technology and the internet that we now have the capability of creating basically a new persona. Thus, the mindset of society has shifted into possibilities to the limitations of what a person can become on the world of the internet. With how incognito the nature of the internet can be, the opportunity to become something and someone else is so viable. We essentially generate our desired identity through social media and constantly mediate this version of ourselves. With more advanced forms of communication such as VR or even the use of virtual characters on streaming, people can bend the limits to their identity. It becomes a question of if such standards ought to be normalized.
