            <h3> AMBI - Music | Immersion | Interaction </h3>
            
                
                <p>
                    Ambi is a music software designed to allow users visualize and interact with the atmosphere of the music they're playing.
                    Players will have an avatar that moves across different rooms depending on the type of music. Ambi can function as it's own 
                    music platform while doubling as a plethora of differnet apps such as meditation, or even a study application. With the huge variety
                    of music that's available along with customizability, Ambi can serve as a competitive overall audio platform geared towards the younger
                    generation to use.
